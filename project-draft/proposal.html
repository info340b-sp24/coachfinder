        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Lots of people want to be more athletic, but often they don't have any idea 
            how to exercise in the gym. In this circumstance, they need to find a personal 
            coach/trainer. However, it's not easy to find a coach that fits a person well now, H
            which leads to problems for those beginner-level fitness people. 
            Also, according to the latest <a href="https://www.ptpioneer.com/personal-trainer-stats/" target="_blank">stats</a>, 
            the number of personal trainers/coaches has increased in these years a lot, 
            but the information is unknown to workout beginners.</p>

<!-- Problem Description Section-->
    <section class="problem-description">
        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>Some gyms provide people with different coaches, but it's often hard to use information technology to find one 
            that fits a person well. This is one of the unaddressed information problems. </p>

        <p>One example of a previous attempt to solve this problem in one form would be the app Exercise.com, which is primarily 
            focused on allowing clients to make progress in the gym, rather than a specific sport. Excercise.com provides users with 
            workout routines and the resources to track their progress, such as a notepad, calorie tracker, and a calendar. Although 
            this can serve to be a very helpful tool in terms of tracking and giving clients a guideline for what to do, someone who
             wants to develop a more esoteric skill / has very specific goals would benefit more from an app that would allow them to 
             find a coach that could satisfy their needs. </p>
