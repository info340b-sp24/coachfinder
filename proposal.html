        <h2>Porject Overview</h2>
        <p>Lots of people want to be more athletic, but often they don’t have any idea how to exercise in the gym. 
            In this circumstance, they need to find a personal coach/trainer. However, it’s not easy to find a coach 
            that fits a person well now, which leads to problems for those beginner-level fitness people.</p>

        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>Some gyms provide people with different coaches, but it’s often hard to use information technology to find one 
            that fits a person well. This is one of the unaddressed information problems. </p>
        <ul>
        <li>One example of a previous attempt to solve this problem in one form would be the app Exercise.com, which is primarily 
            focused on allowing clients to make progress in the gym, rather than a specific sport. Excercise.com provides users with 
            workout routines and the resources to track their progress, such as a notepad, calorie tracker, and a calendar. Although 
            this can serve to be a very helpful tool in terms of tracking and giving clients a guideline for what to do, someone who
             wants to develop a more esoteric skill / has very specific goals would benefit more from an app that would allow them to 
             find a coach that could satisfy their needs. </li>
